# Quiz Archive Worker Service

This section describes the installation of the quiz archive worker service,
that works in conjunction with the [quiz_archiver](https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-quiz_archiver)
Moodle plugin. It can be installed using multiple ways, though using
[Docker Compose](#installation-using-docker-compose) is recommended.

The quiz archive worker service processes quiz archive jobs in the background.
It renders Moodle quiz attempts into PDF files, collects Moodle backups,
generates checksums, and packs the final quiz archives before it uploads it back
the Moodle instance.

## Using the Free Public Demo Service

If you want to try the Quiz Archiver without setting up your own quiz archive
service worker, you can use the free public demo worker.

!!! notice
    The public archive worker service is running in demo mode.
    This means that a _DEMO MODE_ watermark will be added to all generated PDFs
    (see screenshot below), only a limited number of attempts will be exported
    per archive job, and only placeholder Moodle backups are included.

    Setting up your own quiz archive worker service removes these limitations.
    See below for setup instructions.

!!! warning
    The public archive worker service must be able to access your Moodle
    instance via the internet to work. Local and <b>private Moodle instances
    will not work</b> with the demo worker.

To use the free public demo worker, you can skip the installation for now and
directly proceed to the [configuration section](/configuration). Make sure to
specify the following _Archive worker URL_ (1) during configuration:

```text title="Archive worker URL"
https://demoworker.quizarchiver.gandrass.de
```

## Installation using Docker Compose

!!! success "Info"
    This is the suggested way of installing the quiz archive worker service :thumbsup:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` inside a `moodle-quiz-archive-worker` folder
   with the following content:
   ```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
   services:
     moodle-quiz-archive-worker:
       image: ngandrass/moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
       container_name: moodle-quiz-archive-worker
       restart: always
       ports:
         - "8080:8080/tcp"
       environment:
         - QUIZ_ARCHIVER_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```
3. From inside the `moodle-quiz-archive-worker` folder, run the application:
   ```text
   docker compose up
   ```

!!! info "Changing the service port"
    You can change the port that the quiz archive worker service is exposed on
    the Docker host by replacing the first port number in the `ports` argument
    within the `docker-compose.yml` file.

    ```yaml title="Example: Expose the service on port 4242"
    ports:
      - "4242:8080/tcp"
    ```

!!! info "Changing configuration values"
    You can change all [configuration values](#configuration) by setting the
    respective environment variables inside `docker-compose.yml`. For more
    details and all available configuration parameters see [Configuration](#configuration).

    ```yaml title="Example: Set the log level to DEBUG"
    environment:
      - QUIZ_ARCHIVER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
    ```

### Running the application in the background

To run the application in the background, append the `-d` argument to your
command:

```text
docker compose up -d
```

### Removing the application

To remove all created containers, networks and volumes, run the following
command from inside the `moodle-quiz-archive-worker` folder:

```text
docker compose down
```

## Installation using Docker

!!! info
    This is an alternative way of installing the quiz archive worker service
    using Docker directly.

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Run a new container:
  ```text
  docker run -p 8080:8080 ngandrass/moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
  ```

!!! info "Changing the service port"
    You can change the host port the application is bound to by changing the
    first port number in the `-p` argument of the `docker run` command.

    ```text title="Example: Expose the service on port 4242"
    docker run -p 4242:8080 moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
    ```

!!! info "Changing configuration values"
    You can change all [configuration values](#configuration) by setting the
    respective environment variables. For more details and all available
    configuration parameters see [Configuration](#configuration).

    ```text title="Example: Set the log level to DEBUG"
    docker run -e QUIZ_ARCHIVER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG -p 8080:8080 moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest
    ```


### Building the image locally

You can also build the Docker image locally by conducting the following steps:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Clone the Git repository: `git clone https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-quiz-archive-worker`
3. Switch into the repository directory: `cd moodle-quiz-archive-worker`
4. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest .`[^1]
5. Run a container: `docker run -p 8080:8080 moodle-quiz-archive-worker:latest`

[^1]: The `.` at the end of the `docker build` command **must** be part of the
command. It specifies the current directory as the build context.

### Proxy Servers

Should your archive worker be required to access your Moodle instance and other
resources through a proxy server, both [HTTP and SOCKS proxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Implementations_of_proxies)
are supported. You have multiple options to configure the proxy settings as
described below.

#### Using proxy server auto-detection

If no further configuration is performed, the archive worker will automatically
try to detect and use your default system proxy.

During auto-detection, the archive worker looks inside the following environment
variables for proxy configuration data (first match takes precedence):

- `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `all_proxy`,
`ALL_PROXY`

In each case, a full proxy URL including procotol, port and eventually
credentials for authenticating at the proxy server is expected. Examples:

- `http://proxy.example.com:3128`
- `http://10.0.0.2:3128`
- `socks5://foo.bar:1080`
- `http://user:password@myproxy:3128`


!!! info "Setting the environment variables for proxy servers using Docker"
    If you are deploying the archive worker service using Docker, you can set
    the environment variables for the proxy server either for the archive worker
    service specifically inside your `docker-compose.yml` file or [globally
    inside your Docker client](https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/proxy/)[^2].

    ```yaml title="Example: Setting the proxy server URL for the archive worker service"
    environment:
      - HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:3128
    ```

[^2]: You can find details on how to set a global proxy for your Docker client
in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/cli/proxy/).
Be aware, that you the configuration **only applies to new containers** and
builds, and doesn't affect existing containers. Therefore, you need to re-create
all pre-existing containers in order to apply the new proxy settings.

#### Using a different proxy server

You can bypass automatic proxy detection, hereby not using your systems default
proxy, by setting the `QUIZ_ARCHIVER_PROXY_SERVER_URL` environment variable to
the URL of your desired proxy server.

#### Disabling proxy server and auto-detection

To disable automatic proxy detection and use no proxy at all, set the
`QUIZ_ARCHIVER_PROXY_SERVER_URL` environment variable to `False`.

#### Bypassing the proxy for certain domains

The archive worker is also able to bypass the proxy server for a given list
of comma-separated domains. During automatic proxy detection, the environment
variables `no_proxy` and `NO_PROXY` are scanned and listed domains will bypass
the proxy.

If manual proxy configuration is used, you can instead set the
`QUIZ_ARCHIVER_PROXY_BYPASS_DOMAINS` environment variable to a comma-separated
list of domains that will always bypass the proxy server.


## Next Steps

After installing both the Moodle plugin and the archive worker service, you
need to perform the initial [configuration](/configuration) once, to make the
plugin work.
